# Notepad Online
This is just a fun project I'm working on, with no real goal or purpose. It's written in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and only uses one library for encoding purposes.

You can view the current prototype here: https://firecontroller1847.github.io/NotepadOnline/src/index.html

## A Word of Notice
This project is not cleaned up at all. A good majority of this code was written without a plan, late at night, and was 'just to see if I could.' While this is an excellent project to show my porfolio, it is by no means my cleanest code!

If you're interested in a project of mine that contains pre-planned, clean code, and less my experiments, see [ProtoLauncher](https://www.github.com/FireController1847/ProtoLauncher).
